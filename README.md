# My Personal Website

This is just a very basic website that is designed to show some the skills that I learned from the Prep work for the Flatiron coding boot camp, and some of the skills that I developed on my own. This is not intended to be a show stopper, but something simple that stays mostly focused on the material covered in the Prep work.

I hope you enjoy.
